# HERETIC: Interlude - prototype

While the primary purpose of this project is to meet a defined end goal (a basic, working RPG demo, which has a room to walk around in, and a battle scene), it is also to prototype the ideas that will hopefully develop into HERETIC:Interlude

Interlude takes place between the events of HERETIC and Charydbis, and follows a team of hunters in the days immediately following the destruction of the 13th Wall. Kalidibus reaches out to the player, who has the capability to hear her voice. She leads the player and party to her location so they can end the flood, while destroying Manifested Lamentations along the way. 

Interlude's gameplay loop vision is as follows:
- Start in hub world, review missions and potential rewards (Warframe, Darkest Dungeon, etc). Ideally have 4 different worlds with different resource drops, and 1 endgame world to be unlocked post-game.
- Go out on mission and explore the map. Hunt down minor lamentations and collect loot from them. Rather than have random encounters where enemies attack you, you seek them out instead. The only exception would be wandering bosses that the player would have to avoid unless they specifically prepared to fight them. Other things could be found in the missions by wandering around. Lore fragments, class parts (Warframe), loot drops, weapons, accessories, augments etc...
- Once the players MP and items start to run low, end the mission and review a mission end screen which shows everything collected that run
- Return to the hub world and spend loot upgrading character abilities (no skill points, just loot. Alows you to build up other characters without taking them into mission if you want, but levelling still requires participating in combat), upgrading equipment, forging powerful augments, unlocking new jobs (Warframe. Find parts and built them). 
- Once strong enough, challenge the bosses for powerful gear. Defeat all bosses in each area to unlock the final boss, and then the postgame (hard mode) dungeon at the end of the game.
